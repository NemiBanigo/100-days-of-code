# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Re-learning everything about python, had to google how to define a variable.
Also had to read up on how public/private instance variables work (they don't, everything is public in python).

**Thoughts:** Need to make objects feel more natural
