**Today's Progress**: Re-learning everything about python, had to google how to define a variable.
Also had to read up on how public/private instance variables work (they don't, everything is public in python).
Lots to re-read about, lists, dicts, classes etc. Not come very far but think an idea of how the game will be structured are begining to take place.

**Thoughts:** Need to make using objects feel more natural

### Day 2: April 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Defined lots of classes for NPC's using inheritance. Starting to get a hang of how it works.
Also read a bunch of stuff on balancing game stats/exp gain etc. Not really relevant at this stage, need to get more stuff working before worrying about it. Done some minor functions for damage for the player as well, hard to figure out the best way to solve the problem. The code is the easy part, the how is whats hard.

**Thoughts:** Less thinking about feature K when im still implementing feature B, build a core, then expand.

### Day 3: April 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a bunch of class methods and started working on an event class. Have done alot of "drawing" out how to handle the mechanics of the game class wise. 

**Thoughts:** The hard part is always defining the problem and how to solve it, the code part, so far, is easy.
Already i feel my grip on OOP has become much better when not following a tutorial or a guide. When i have to define a problem, solve it and then code it the reason for using OOP suddenly feels much more natural than just following guides on how to use them.

### Day 4: April 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Banging my head against super in multiple class inheritance. It runs now, not sure if im doing it right...

**Thoughts:** Bloody forehead..

### Day 5,6,7: April 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Weekend to Paris, managed to code on the plan both ways but missed saturday.

**Thoughts:** Coding without google is HARD!

### Day 8: April 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fought with using threads to read user input while preserving the while loop game thread. Like always the solution, once in hand, was quite simple.

**Thoughts:** Threads are awesome, lets abuse them and break everything!

### Day 9: April 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed typed commands to fully work, tried different methods of exiting the program (seems os.exit() works best in multiple threads). Fixed a few errors showing up once more methods worked and discovered more needing fixing. Guess thats the downside of getting more of the code thats never actually been run to run, you realised it does'nt work :)

**Thoughts:** Writing code without testing it NEVER works once you test it.

### Day 10: April 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Could not muster motivation to work on my current game today, so instead made a tic tac toe game. Managed to get everything except the vitctory condition running. Did most of it with no tutorial as i don't want to copy code but actually have to solve problems on my own.

**Thoughts:** Don't follow tutorials too much.

### Day 11: April 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Basically completed the game with uninportant features like winning, preventing cheating, keeping the game running, score and input validation.

**Thoughts:** if not worked wierd today, will have to read further as why it did not work..

### Day 12: April 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Bad motivation today. Started with an ant simulator game but got stuck at pathfinding and generating random objects on a map grid. Might take it up again later but pathfinding might need to be a module or something rather than done from scratch, it seems HARD!

**Thoughts:** Sometimes wanting too much makes you hit a wall, KISS (keep it simple, stupid)!

**Link to work:** Did't upload it yet

### Day 13: April 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Running out of ideas so i took to the internetz and started going through the projects over at http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/
Only did the reverse string and a semi working pig-latin today. Feels like it will be a good way to develop, even if the projects are a bit boring at times. Pig latin will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Going outside of ones comfort zone is always a good way to learn.

### Day 14: April 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a simple RSS feed reader (mostly stole the code tbh, but at least i understood it) and a few simple count words/vowels functions. Still doing the bare minimum, need to get that motivation back for longer sessions.

**Thoughts:** If you steal code, understand every part of it before running it.

### Day 15: April 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Redid RSS reader with my own "words", making the code a lot shorter and, for me, easier to read. Struggling to sort articles by date when having multiple sources. Seems different sites use different time/date standards so might have a bit of issue to get it right. Right now i get it in input order, which is chronological by site.

**Thoughts:** Make code your own by writing it yourself.

### Day 16: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: So, jumping between projects like a mad man. Did lots of reading today on ciphers from the excellent https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/
Then i did some tutorials on server/client sockets, which has absolutly nothing to do with ciphers. Mostly copying code while trying to understand what it does so far, will see if/where i take it. Have an idea to write some form of peer to peer program, doing something smart with the connections.

**Thoughts:** My attention is about as stable as a rabbit on speed.

### Day 17: April 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple FTP client that i never tested (did not want to set up an FTP server just for testing it). Simple as in takes server/username/password/ftps as input and connects then does a dir, so no downloading/uploading. Also attempted to make CLI utilities using Click. Have some issues using PyCharm as the tutorials are all using something else.

**Thoughts:** Im getting tired of tutorials written for python 2x...

### Day 18: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Based on what i learned earlier about Click i made a password generator command line utility. It needs some polish to work correctly but all the features are there.

**Thoughts:** Learning modules seems to be a lot more intense than learning python itself, soo many modules...
