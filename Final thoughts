## Achivement unlocked!
Yesterday was the last day of my 100daysOfCode. After some trouble counting correctly and 4 missed days I finally made it to the end!

While in no way a good programmer I have come a long way since day 1. While learning Python I touched on many different modules and produced some decent command line utilities. It made me get in the habit of solving problems programatically and thinking in a more program like manner.

After that i switched over to C#, which has been a rather rough road. Motivation was much harder to come by, mainly due to it being harder and the pace of production being much slower. I have yet to produce anything of value and still struggle to find projects to work on.
But im happy I did switch, since learning a slightly less abstracted language has made me understand some concepts a lot better. C# also has an unmached integration into Windows and being a windows guy it is guaranteed to be more useful to me in the long run.

My next big challenge will be to find a project to work on that motivates me enough to put in the hours required. Im good at coming up with projects but bad at sticking with them, also a challenge I need to tackle.

Other than the apparent increase in programming experience theese 100 days have taught me a lot about myself, motivation and the importance of doing something frequently to really learn it.
I will aproach new skills completly differently knowing what I now know and hopefully it will make learning new skills a lot easier.
